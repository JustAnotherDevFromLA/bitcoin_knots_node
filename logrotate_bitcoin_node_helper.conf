    # If the services were writing directly, we might need to restart them.
    # For now, these logs are written by cron jobs, so no service restart is strictly needed.
    # However, if any service does start logging here directly, uncomment and adjust:
    # postrotate
    #   systemctl reload-or-restart bitcoind.service electrs.service nginx.service # adjust as needed
    # endscript
